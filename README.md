# Bologna Air Quality Index (AQI) 🌍🌫️

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes and predicts **Air Quality Index (AQI)** levels in **Bologna, Italy**, using machine learning techniques.  
The main goal is to classify air quality into categories (e.g., Good, Moderate, Unhealthy) based on pollutant concentrations and related features.  

By leveraging historical air quality data and applying machine learning, the project provides insights into pollution trends and demonstrates how supervised learning can be used for environmental monitoring.
